<h1>ABOUT PROJECT :</h1>
<p>In today's fast-paced educational landscape, the efficient management of student attendance,
assessments,and academic records is paramount to the success of any educational institution. Recognizing 
this need, we present the Attendance and Internal Management System (AIMS), a comprehensive
software solution tailored to empower college faculty in their daily academic responsibilities. This webbased system harnesses the power of Java, JSP, Servlets, and JDBC technologies to provide a robust,
user-friendly, andsecure platform for managing key academic processes.
The AIMS project seeks to address the challenges faced by faculty members in traditional attendance
tracking, question paper preparation, and internal assessments. By automating these essential tasks and
centralizing departmental data, the system aims to enhance the overall efficiency, accuracy, and
productivityof academic management within the college.</p>
